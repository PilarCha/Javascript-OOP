This function should return the total monthly bill for the customer, rounded to 2 decimal places.

If there are no users or the subscription is not present, the function should return 0 since the customer does not owe anything for that month.
Calculation Examples

Here is an example of calculating the amount to bill each customer using the algorithm described above. This example is captured by the "works when a user is activated during the month" test.

Month 	2019-01
Subscription tier 	$4 / month
User activations 	2018-11-04
2018-12-04
2019-01-10 (new this month)
User deactivations 	None

Daily rate is $4.00 / 31 days => $0.129032258 / day

2019-01-01  2 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.258064516  (subtotal: $0.258064516)
2019-01-02  2 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.258064516  (subtotal: $0.516129032)
...
2019-01-09  2 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.258064516  (subtotal: $2.322580645)
2019-01-10  3 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.387096774  (subtotal: $2.709677419)
2019-01-11  3 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.387096774  (subtotal: $4.387096772)
...
2019-01-30  3 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.387096774  (subtotal: $10.451612903)
2019-01-31  3 active users * $0.129032258 = $0.387096774  (subtotal: $10.838709677)

Total = $10.84 (round subtotal to nearest cent)

Testing

The automated tests we provide only cover a few key cases, so you should plan to add some of your own tests or modify the existing ones to ensure that your solution handles any edge cases. You should be able to follow the existing patterns for naming and constructing tests to add your own.
Notes / Edge cases

    Itâ€™s more important for the return value to be correct than it is for the algorithm to be highly optimized.
    You can store intermediate results as any kind of decimal type (e.g. float, double). You do not need to round values until the last step.
    You should not change function names or return types of the provided functions since our test cases depend on those not changing.

Time guidance

Aim to take between 25-45 minutes for this challenge. Set a timer now for 45 minutes to gauge the time you have spent on this challenge.

If you have spent 45 or more minutes:

    Stop working
    Document where you are at in the "Your Notes" section in the upper right corner
    Go on to the next challenge. It is independent from any solution you got on this challenge.
    You can return to any incomplete challenges if you have time left over at the end.
